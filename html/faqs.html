        How does it work? What do I need to do?
      </h3>

      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; line-height:16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">
        Your credit line has been automatically increased - you do not need to do anything or send in an additional security deposit for this.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h3" style="font-size:14px; line-height: 19.6px; margin:0 0 10px;">
        When can I start using it?
      </h3>

      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; line-height:16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">
        Right away! You can use the increased credit line amount immediately.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h3" style="font-size:14px; line-height: 19.6px; margin:0 0 10px;">
        What if I don't want the credit line increase?
      </h3>

      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; line-height:16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">
        You can call Customer Service at 1-800-859-6412 (we are here 24/7) and request to be excluded from the automatic credit line increase program. Please note that this will exclude you from all future credit line increases as well.
      </p>

        Will this affect my credit score?
      </h3>

      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; line-height:16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">
        Your new credit limit will be reported to the credit bureaus immediately following your next billing statement. Now you can spend more and maintain the same utilization rate. Your credit score is impacted by various factors, including, but
        not limited to, the length of your history, the type & amount of your credit lines & your utilization, and your payment history.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h3" style="font-size:14px; line-height: 19.6px; margin:0 0 10px;">
        Can this change my credit card statement balance?
      </h3>

      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; line-height:16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">
        Your assigned credit line does not impact your balance. Your monthly statement balance is based on beginning balance plus, the total amount of transactions (purchases and cash advances), less any payments and credits plus, any fees and
        interest charges.
