      <h3 class="h3" style="font-size:14px; line-height: 19.6px; margin:0 0 10px;">Do I have to sign-up for the OpenSky Visa Gold Card?</h3>
      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; 16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">The OpenSky Gold Card is currently available by invitation to existing OpenSky Secured Card customers<br> only. This email is your invitation. </p>

      <h3 class="h3" style="font-size:14px; line-height: 19.6px; margin:0 0 10px;">Am I already approved?</h3>
      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; 16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">Yes, you are already approved. Clicking the button above will take you to a landing page where we will<br> simply need to verify your personal details – that’s how we know to
        send your new
        Visa
        Gold Card to<br> you. There is no application.</p>

      <h3 class="h3" style="font-size:14px; line-height: 19.6px; margin:0 0 10px;">Is there a credit check for this card?</h3>
      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; 16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">No, there is absolutely no credit check when you sign up for the OpenSky Gold Card. </p>

      <h3 class="h3" style="font-size:14px; line-height: 19.6px; margin:0 0 10px;">Do I need to provide a security deposit for this card?</h3>
      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; 16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">No. It is not a secured card. You will receive a brand new card with it’s own credit limit, and it will be<br> reported to all three major credit bureaus as an additional trade
        line. </p>

      <h3 class="h3" style="font-size:14px; line-height: 19.6px; margin:0 0 10px;">Will this affect my credit score?</h3>
      <p class="faqs-p" style="font-size: 11px; 16.8px; margin:0 0 20px;">The OpenSky Visa Gold Card is the perfect companion to your existing OpenSky Secured Card. It gives<br> you more spending ability and flexibility to manage your expenses, while
        continuing to
        build your<br> credit. Now you can spend more and maintain the same utilization rate. Your credit score is impacted<br> by various factors, including, but not limited to, the length of your history, the type and amount of<br> your credit
        lines, your
        utilization, and your payment history.</p>
